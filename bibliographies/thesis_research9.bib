            While the terrestrial base stations (TBSs) in the fifth‐generation (5G) network provide high throughput for the conventional terrestrial users (TUs), it is still challenging for the network to support massive TUs and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) simultaneously due to the complicated air–ground channel and severe interference. In this paper, the deployment of a high‐altitude platform (HAP) as a supplement for the terrestrial networks, in which the HAP and TBSs serve TUs and UAVs simultaneously in a joint manner, is studied. The novel network has two challenges. First, the deployment of the HAP, which is a new degree of freedom, should be optimized considering the terrestrial network. Second, the channel of the joint HAP and TBS network that serves multiple TUs and UAVs concurrently is complicated, and the resource allocation of the network should be designed. To tackle the above two challenges, a joint resource allocation and HAP deployment problem are formulated, and a gradient‐and‐matching‐based algorithm is proposed to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that the HAP and the proposed algorithm enhance the sum‐rate of the network by over 30\%, and the average data rate of both the TUs and the UAVs can be effectively improved.},

	abstract = {In this study, we consider a security efficiency maximization problem in a multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided system with mobile edge computing (MEC). Two kinds of UAVs, including multiple computing UAVs (CUAVs) and multiple jamming UAVs (JUAVs), are considered in this system. CUAVs would receive partial computation bits and send the computation results to ground users. JUAVs do not undertake computing tasks and only send interference signals to counter potential ground eavesdroppers. We jointly optimize the ground user scheduling, UAV power, and UAV trajectory to maximize the security efficiency. The original problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We first use the Dinkelbach method combined with continuous convex approximation technology, and then propose three corresponding subproblems, including user scheduling subproblem, UAV power subproblem, and UAV trajectory problem. Further, we apply the branch and bound method to solve the user scheduling subproblem, and optimize the two remaining subproblems by introducing auxiliary variables and Taylor expansion. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain better secure off-loading efficiency with respect to the existing schemes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a network architecture where two types of aerial infrastructures together with a ground station provide connectivity to a remote area. A high altitude platform station (HAPS) is equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, to be exploited to assist the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks. A key challenge in such networks is the restricted number of UAVs, which limits full coverage and leaves some users unsupported. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical bilevel optimization framework including a leader and a follower problem. The users served by HAPS-RIS are in a zone called HAPS-RIS zone and the users served by the UAVs are in another zone called UAV zone. In the leader problem, the goal is to establish the zone boundary and practical RIS phase shift design that maximizes the number of users covered by HAPS-RIS while ensuring that users in this zone meet their rate requirements. This is achieved through our proposed relaxation method and algorithm based on the RIS clustering concept. The follower problem focuses on minimizing the number of UAVs required, ensuring that the rate requirements of the users in the UAV zone are met. This is addressed through our proposed dynamic method adopting k-means clustering technique with adaptive UAV selection. Our study reveals that increasing the number of RIS elements significantly decreases the number of required UAVs.},

	abstract = {With the advances in computation, sensor, communication and networking technologies, utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for military and civilian areas has become extremely popular for the last two decades. Since small UAVs are relatively cheap, the focus is changing, and usage of several small UAVs is preferred rather than one large UAV. This change in orientation is dramatic, and it is resulting to develop new networking technologies between UAVs, which can constitute swarm UAV teams for executing specific tasks with different levels of intra and inter vehicle communication especially for coordination and control of the system. Setting up a UAV network not only extends operational scope and range but also enables quick and reliable response time. Because UAVs are highly mobile nodes for networking, setting up an ad-hoc network is a challenging issue, and this networking has some requirements, which differ from traditional networks, mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in terms of connectivity, routing process, services, applications, etc. In this paper, it is aimed to point out the challenges in the usage of UAVs as mobile nodes in an ad-hoc network and to depict open research issues with analyzing the opportunities and future work s .},

However, the inherent openness of the air-ground channel poses a signiﬁcant vulnerability, allowing for potential eavesdropping by unauthorized entities. To address this, we consider a secure MEC multi-layer air-ground network model that employs nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for improving spectral efﬁciency and physical layer security (PLS) for securing wireless transmission. Our objective is to maximize the system’s minimum secure ofﬂoading sum rate by jointly optimizing task computation latency, task scheduling, and transmit power of legitimate users (LUs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while subject to secrecy constraints. To this end, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-problems and utilizes the matching game theory, heuristic algorithm, and successive convex approximation to solve them. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in signiﬁcantly enhancing the system’s minimum secure ofﬂoading sum rate.},

	abstract = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will inevitably be integrated into future cellular networks as new aerial mobile users. Providing cellular connectivity to UAVs will enable a myriad of applications ranging from online video streaming to medical delivery. However, to enable a reliable wireless connectivity for the UAVs as well as a secure operation, various challenges need to be addressed such as interference management, mobility management and handover, cyber-physical attacks, and authentication. In this paper, the goal is to expose the wireless and security challenges that arise in the context of UAV-based delivery systems, UAV-based real-time multimedia streaming, and UAV-enabled intelligent transportation systems. To address such challenges, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) based solution schemes are introduced. The introduced approaches enable the UAVs to adaptively exploit the wireless system resources while guaranteeing a secure operation, in real-time. Preliminary simulation results show the beneﬁts of the introduced solutions for each of the aforementioned cellular-connected UAV application use case.},

For example, quantum techniques are being integrated with classical neural networks to perform machine learning. In order to be used in this way, or for any other widespread use like quantum chemistry simulations or cryptographic applications, classical data must be converted into quantum states through quantum encoding. There are three fundamental encoding methods: basis, amplitude, and rotation, as well as several proposed combinations. This study explores the encoding methods, specifically in the context of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. Using the QuClassi quantum neural network architecture to perform binary classification of the ‘3’ and ‘6’ digits from the MNIST datasets, this study obtains several metrics such as accuracy, entropy, loss, and resistance to noise, while considering resource usage and computational complexity to compare the three main encoding methods.},

A Rician K-factor is used to describe the fading severity in a Rician fading channel and is used in the system design and performance evaluation. Therefore, the estimation of the Rician K-factor is important in wireless communications research and development. Traditionally, a Rician K-factor equation, the statistics of the instantaneous frequency of the received signal with a lookup table, or the James-Stein estimator with the maximum likelihood estimation is used for the K-factor estimation. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning for K-factor estimation. Speciﬁcally, we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the Rician K-factor from a waveform signal in a Rician channel. Numerical results demonstrate its good performance in estimating the K-factor of the Rician channel.},

Traditional methods for acquiring crop traits, such as plant height, leaf color, leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, biomass and yield, rely on manual sampling, which is time-consuming and laborious. Unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing platforms (UAV-RSPs) equipped with different sensors have recently become an important approach for fast and non-destructive high throughput phenotyping and have the advantage of ﬂexible and convenient operation, on-demand access to data and high spatial resolution. UAV-RSPs are a powerful tool for studying phenomics and genomics. As the methods and applications for ﬁeld phenotyping using UAVs to users who willing to derive phenotypic parameters from large ﬁelds and tests with the minimum effort on ﬁeld work and getting highly reliable results are necessary, the current status and perspectives on the topic of UAV-RSPs for ﬁeld-based phenotyping were reviewed based on the literature survey of crop phenotyping using UAV-RSPs in the Web of ScienceTM Core Collection database and cases study by NERCITA. The reference for the selection of UAV platforms and remote sensing sensors, the commonly adopted methods and typical applications for analyzing phenotypic traits by UAV-RSPs, and the challenge for crop phenotyping by UAV-RSPs were considered. The review can provide theoretical and technical support to promote the applications of UAV-RSPs for crop phenotyping.},

We aim to maximize the total throughput for all the users and meet the fairness requirement by optimizing the UAVs’ trajectories and transmission power in a centralized way. This problem is non-convex and very difﬁcult to solve, as the locations of the user are unknown to the UAVs. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution, i.e., soft actor-critic (SAC) to address it via modeling the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). We carefully design the reward function that combines sparse with non-sparse reward to achieve the balance between exploitation and exploration.

	abstract = {When Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) perform high-precision communication tasks, such as searching for users and providing emergency coverage, positioning errors between base stations and users make it challenging to deploy trajectory planning algorithms. To address these challenges caused by position errors, a framework was proposed to compensate it by Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), which stores channel state information (CSI). By taking the positions with errors as input, the generated CKM could give a prediction of signal attenuation which is close to true positions. Based on that, the predictions are utilized to calculate the received power and a PPO-based algorithm is applied to optimize the compensation. After training, the framework is able to find a strategy that minimize the flight time under communication constraints and positioning error. Besides, the confidence interval is calculated to assist the allocation of power and the update of CKM is studied to adapt to the dynamic environment. Simulation results show the robustness of CKM to positioning error and environmental changes, and the superiority of CKMassisted UAV communication design.},

In this paper, we consider an energy-efﬁcient design for intelligent reﬂecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output multipleeavesdropper (MIMOME) wiretap channels (WTC). Our objective is to jointly optimize the transmit covariance matrix and the IRS phase-shifts to maximize the secrecy energy efﬁciency (SEE) of the considered system subject to a secrecy rate constraint at the legitimate receiver. To tackle this challenging non-convex problem in which the design variables are coupled in the objective and the constraint, we propose a penalty dual decomposition based alternating gradient projection (PDDAPG) method to obtain an efﬁcient solution. We also show that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm grows only linearly with the number of reﬂecting elements at the IRS, as well as with the number of antennas at transmitter/receivers’ nodes. Our results conﬁrm that using an IRS is helpful to improve the SEE of MIMOME WTC compared to its no-IRS counterpart only when the power consumption at IRS is small. In particular, and a large-sized IRS is not always beneﬁcial for the SEE of a MIMOME WTC.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms are ubiquitous in applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Due to the structure of conventional parametrized quantum gates, the evaluated functions typically are finite Fourier series of the input parameters. In this work, we use this fact to derive new, general parameter-shift rules for single-parameter gates, and provide closed-form expressions to apply them. These rules are then extended to multi-parameter quantum gates by combining them with the stochastic parameter-shift rule. We perform a systematic analysis of quantum resource requirements for each rule, and show that a reduction in resources is possible for higher-order derivatives. Using the example of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, we show that the generalized parameter-shift rule can reduce the number of circuit evaluations significantly when computing derivatives with respect to parameters that feed into many gates. Our approach additionally reproduces reconstructions of the evaluated function up to a chosen order, leading to known generalizations of the Rotosolve optimizer and new extensions of the quantum analytic descent optimization algorithm.},

	abstract = {We utilize hybrid quantum deep reinforcement learning to learn navigation tasks for a simple, wheeled robot in simulated environments of increasing complexity. For this, we train parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with two different encoding strategies in a hybrid quantum-classical setup as well as a classical neural network baseline with the double deep Q network (DDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm. Quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) has previously been studied in several relatively simple benchmark environments, mainly from the OpenAI gym suite. However, scaling behavior and applicability of QDRL to more demanding tasks closer to real-world problems e. g., from the robotics domain, have not been studied previously. Here, we show that quantum circuits in hybrid quantum-classic reinforcement learning setups are capable of learning optimal policies in multiple robotic navigation scenarios with notably fewer trainable parameters compared to a classical baseline. Across a large number of experimental configurations, we find that the employed quantum circuits outperform the classical neural network baselines when equating for the number of trainable parameters. Yet, the classical neural network consistently showed better results concerning training times and stability, with at least one order of magnitude of trainable parameters more than the best-performing quantum circuits. However, validating the robustness of the learning methods in a large and dynamic environment, we find that the classical baseline produces more stable and better performing policies overall. For the two encoding schemes, we observed better results for consecutively encoding the classical state vector on each qubit compared to encoding each component on a separate qubit. Our findings demonstrate that current hybrid quantum machine-learning approaches can be scaled to simple robotic problems while yielding sufficient results, at least in an idealized simulated setting, but there are yet open questions regarding the application to considerably more demanding tasks. We anticipate that our work will contribute to introducing quantum machine learning in general and quantum deep reinforcement learning in particular to more demanding problem domains and emphasize the importance of encoding techniques for classic data in hybrid quantum-classical settings.},

In this work we propose three different transpilation approaches, based on a localized term-replacement scheme, to substantially reduce circuit lengths while preserving the unitary operation implemented by the circuit. The first variant is based on a stochastic search scheme, and the other variants are driven by a database retrieval scheme and a machine learning based decision support. We show that our proposed methods generate short quantum circuits for restricted gate sets, superior to the typical results obtained by using different qiskit optimization levels. Our method can be applied to different gate sets and scales well with an arbitrary number of qubits.},

Research in this area has focused primarily on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and several proposals to enhance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with VQAs have been put forward. Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments.},

A UAV collects data from a set of randomly distributed sensors, where both the locations of these sensors and their data volume to be transmitted are unknown to the UAV. In order to assist the UAV in ﬁnding the optimal motion trajectory in the face of the uncertainty without the above knowledge whilst aiming for maximizing the cumulative collected data, we formulate a reinforcement learning problem by modelling the motion-trajectory as a Markov decision process with the UAV acting as the learning agent. Then, we propose a pair of novel trajectory optimization algorithms based on stochastic modelling and reinforcement learning, which allows the UAV to optimize its ﬂight trajectory without the need for system identiﬁcation. More speciﬁcally, by dividing the considered region into small tiles, we conceive state-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) and Q-learning based UAV-trajectory optimization algorithms (i.e., SUTOA and QUTOA) aiming to maximize the cumulative data collected during the ﬁnite ﬂight-time. Our simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed approaches are capable of ﬁnding an optimal trajectory under the ﬂight-time constraint. The preference for QUTOA vs. SUTOA depends on the relative position of the start and the end points of the UAVs.},

This is due to UAV limited energy budget and the importance of time for search operations. The objective of this study is to come up with an approach to minimize the total search time required to locate a specific target. To achieve this, we deployed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of UAV search path planning within a minimized search time. A smart reward formulation is designed to achieve the learning goal, fulfill the search requirement, and encourage the agent to select search paths that minimize search time. In addition, we employed Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework to systematically select optimal parameters for the PPO model. Most importantly, thanks to the state representation we considered, the model is generalized and adaptable to various search environments. The PPO model succeeds to compute an accurate search path to be followed by the UAV searcher. Results of the model are compared with results previously obtained with a linear program. We found that the PPO achieves almost the same expected search time, which proves the great relevance of the reward design and the hyperparameters selection we made.},

These simulations often work on the link level with simulation time far off from wall clock time, making them impracticable to be deployed for the performance analysis of real hardware in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) environments or prototype vehicles. Probabilistic communication models can help in this regard, however often suffer from considerably lower accuracy than link-level simulations. It was shown that determining whether a communication link is of Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) nature greatly increases the quality of probabilistic communication models. This paper presents such an LOS probability model for VANETs in urban and rural environments. We ﬁnd that typical urban environments such as rural, urban, and industrial areas show similar characteristics across different German and European cities. We utilize this to derive a probabilistic LOS model that reliably predicts LOS constellations and outperforms related work. Our model therefore enables the development of accurate probabilistic packet success or packet arrival rate models to investigate VANET technology in real-time environments.},

	abstract = {The line-of-sight (LoS) condition is important to the quality of wireless communications, especially for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications which are more sensitive to blockages than typical radio frequency (RF) communications. Considering that one blockage would obstruct several channels simultaneously, recently, researchers have studied the correlation of LoS probabilities among multiple channels in the horizontal plane and shown its importance in system performance analysis. The main missing aspect of existing literature in this direction is that the heights of transceivers and blockages have not been considered in the analysis of the LoS correlation. However, the emerging hybrid cellular networks with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) deployed at various altitudes necessitate the LoS analysis accounting for the vertical dimension. In this paper, using stochastic geometry, we formulate a novel joint-LoS-probability framework of two channels among three aerial/terrestrial devices to analyze the LoS correlation both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. We derive the expression of the conditional and joint LoS probabilities. The proposed framework combines (i) accuracy (veriﬁed in simulation), (ii) generality (from adjustable parameters of the channels and environments), and (iii) ﬁtting ability (from a cylindrical blockage model to a non-cylindrical blockage model). The numerical results show that the correlation is quite strong when the angle between the two communication channels is small, while it becomes weaker as this angle increases. Moreover, we introduce a potential application of the joint LoS probability in the optimal deployment of an aerial device. Compared to optimization based on the independence assumption of the LoS probabilities, the improvement in the coverage probability intuitively clariﬁes the advantage of the proposed joint-LoS-probability framework on the aerial-terrestrial network design.},

	abstract = {Dispatching unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to harvest sensing-data from distributed sensors is expected to signiﬁcantly improve the data collection efﬁciency in conventional wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled WSN, where a ﬂying UAV is employed to collect data from multiple sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to maximize the minimum average data collection rate from all SNs subject to a prescribed reliability constraint for each SN by jointly optimizing the UAV communication scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory. Different from the existing works that assume the simpliﬁed line-of-sight (LoS) UAV-ground channels, we consider the more practically accurate angledependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and SNs with the Rician factors determined by the corresponding UAV-SN elevation angles. However, the formulated optimization problem is intractable due to the lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter termed effective fading power that characterizes the achievable rate given the reliability requirement in terms of outage probability. To tackle this difﬁculty, we ﬁrst approximate the parameter by a logistic (“S” shape) function with respect to the 3D UAV trajectory by using the data regression method. Then, the original problem is reformulated to an approximate form, which, however, is still challenging to solve due to its nonconvexity. As such, we further propose an efﬁcient algorithm to derive its suboptimal solution by using the block coordinate descent technique, which iteratively optimizes the communication scheduling, the UAV’s horizontal trajectory, and its vertical trajectory. The latter two subproblems are shown to be non-convex, while locally optimal solutions are obtained for them by using the successive convex approximation technique. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and draw new insights on the 3D UAV trajectory under the Rician fading as compared to conventional LoS channel models.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigate how unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may serve as relays in cooperative communication using the Decode and Forward (DF) protocol. We apply the Rician channel assumption and study the Symbol Error Rate (SER) to account for the potential of obstacles blocking the line-of-sight (LoS) link throughout nodes and UAVs, as well as to observe fluctuations in the LoS signal induced by the fading effect (SER). A channel model between each pair of neighbors inside the UAV network must be designed to improve the performance of each network. The network coding (NC) technique provides greater spectral efficiency and full diversity when employed in multiuser cooperative communication systems. However, the addition of error control codes can improve the efficiency of a scheme in relay-based multiuser cooperative network-based UAVs. These factors motivate the use of NC in wireless cooperative UAV networks in a Rician fading scenario. We analyzed this concept in detail in this work, utilizing several UAV relaying strategies such as DF (decode and forward). According to simulation results, coding for a Rician fading scenario significantly improves overall delay performance in the cooperative UAV communications environment.},

Initially, a signal reception model for the base station-UAV and UAV-user dual-hop links based on the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol is presented. A time-varying Rician channel model related to the elevation angle is established, and a first-order approximation expression for the outage probability is derived, followed by an analysis of the system's outage performance. Subsequently, based on the criterion of minimizing outage probability, a joint optimization method for trajectory and power allocation is proposed: optimizing the transmission power allocation while fixing the UAV's heading angle, and then optimizing the UAV's heading angle while keeping the power allocation factor constant. Finally, simulations validate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization scheme.},

The warden adopts a radiometer to detect the covert transmission. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the optimal detection threshold and calculate the minimum detection error probability. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of outage probability via UAV relaying is derived over Rician fading. Then, a power optimization problem is formulated to maximize the effective convert throughput with covertness constraint. Numerical results illustrate that the cooperative jamming can disrupt the warden, and the optimal power tradeoff can guarantee the covert transmission effectively.},

This paper considers a multiuser communication system, in which a single-antenna UAV-BS serves a large number of ground users by employing nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The max-min rate optimization problem is formulated under total power, total bandwidth, UAV altitude, and antenna beamwidth constraints. The objective of max-min rate optimization is non-convex in all optimization variables, i.e., UAV altitude, transmit antenna beamwidth, power allocation, and bandwidth allocation for multiple users. A pathfollowing algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem. Next, orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and dirty paper coding (DPC)-based max-min rate optimization problems are formulated and respective path-following algorithms are developed to solve them. The numerical results show that NOMA outperforms OMA and achieves rates similar to those attained by DPC. In addition, a clear rate gain is observed by jointly optimizing all the parameters rather than optimizing a subset of parameters, which conﬁrms the desirability of their joint optimization.},
