# MEngSc Thesis
This repository contains my MEngSc thesis, titled "Quantum-Assisted Optimisation of Secret Key Rate Exchange for UAV Communications using a Rician Channel Model for Physical Layer Security", which I completed under Dr. Anshu Mukherjee as part of my MEngSc in Electronic & Computer Engineering in UCD. 
The code that I wrote for this project can be found at https://github.com/piersk/EEEN40290_Thesis.
