            While the terrestrial base stations (TBSs) in the fifth‐generation (5G) network provide high throughput for the conventional terrestrial users (TUs), it is still challenging for the network to support massive TUs and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) simultaneously due to the complicated air–ground channel and severe interference. In this paper, the deployment of a high‐altitude platform (HAP) as a supplement for the terrestrial networks, in which the HAP and TBSs serve TUs and UAVs simultaneously in a joint manner, is studied. The novel network has two challenges. First, the deployment of the HAP, which is a new degree of freedom, should be optimized considering the terrestrial network. Second, the channel of the joint HAP and TBS network that serves multiple TUs and UAVs concurrently is complicated, and the resource allocation of the network should be designed. To tackle the above two challenges, a joint resource allocation and HAP deployment problem are formulated, and a gradient‐and‐matching‐based algorithm is proposed to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that the HAP and the proposed algorithm enhance the sum‐rate of the network by over 30\%, and the average data rate of both the TUs and the UAVs can be effectively improved.},

	abstract = {In this study, we consider a security efficiency maximization problem in a multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided system with mobile edge computing (MEC). Two kinds of UAVs, including multiple computing UAVs (CUAVs) and multiple jamming UAVs (JUAVs), are considered in this system. CUAVs would receive partial computation bits and send the computation results to ground users. JUAVs do not undertake computing tasks and only send interference signals to counter potential ground eavesdroppers. We jointly optimize the ground user scheduling, UAV power, and UAV trajectory to maximize the security efficiency. The original problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We first use the Dinkelbach method combined with continuous convex approximation technology, and then propose three corresponding subproblems, including user scheduling subproblem, UAV power subproblem, and UAV trajectory problem. Further, we apply the branch and bound method to solve the user scheduling subproblem, and optimize the two remaining subproblems by introducing auxiliary variables and Taylor expansion. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain better secure off-loading efficiency with respect to the existing schemes.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a network architecture where two types of aerial infrastructures together with a ground station provide connectivity to a remote area. A high altitude platform station (HAPS) is equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, to be exploited to assist the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks. A key challenge in such networks is the restricted number of UAVs, which limits full coverage and leaves some users unsupported. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical bilevel optimization framework including a leader and a follower problem. The users served by HAPS-RIS are in a zone called HAPS-RIS zone and the users served by the UAVs are in another zone called UAV zone. In the leader problem, the goal is to establish the zone boundary and practical RIS phase shift design that maximizes the number of users covered by HAPS-RIS while ensuring that users in this zone meet their rate requirements. This is achieved through our proposed relaxation method and algorithm based on the RIS clustering concept. The follower problem focuses on minimizing the number of UAVs required, ensuring that the rate requirements of the users in the UAV zone are met. This is addressed through our proposed dynamic method adopting k-means clustering technique with adaptive UAV selection. Our study reveals that increasing the number of RIS elements significantly decreases the number of required UAVs.},

	abstract = {With the advances in computation, sensor, communication and networking technologies, utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for military and civilian areas has become extremely popular for the last two decades. Since small UAVs are relatively cheap, the focus is changing, and usage of several small UAVs is preferred rather than one large UAV. This change in orientation is dramatic, and it is resulting to develop new networking technologies between UAVs, which can constitute swarm UAV teams for executing specific tasks with different levels of intra and inter vehicle communication especially for coordination and control of the system. Setting up a UAV network not only extends operational scope and range but also enables quick and reliable response time. Because UAVs are highly mobile nodes for networking, setting up an ad-hoc network is a challenging issue, and this networking has some requirements, which differ from traditional networks, mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in terms of connectivity, routing process, services, applications, etc. In this paper, it is aimed to point out the challenges in the usage of UAVs as mobile nodes in an ad-hoc network and to depict open research issues with analyzing the opportunities and future work s .},

However, the inherent openness of the air-ground channel poses a signiﬁcant vulnerability, allowing for potential eavesdropping by unauthorized entities. To address this, we consider a secure MEC multi-layer air-ground network model that employs nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for improving spectral efﬁciency and physical layer security (PLS) for securing wireless transmission. Our objective is to maximize the system’s minimum secure ofﬂoading sum rate by jointly optimizing task computation latency, task scheduling, and transmit power of legitimate users (LUs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while subject to secrecy constraints. To this end, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-problems and utilizes the matching game theory, heuristic algorithm, and successive convex approximation to solve them. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in signiﬁcantly enhancing the system’s minimum secure ofﬂoading sum rate.},

	abstract = {Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will inevitably be integrated into future cellular networks as new aerial mobile users. Providing cellular connectivity to UAVs will enable a myriad of applications ranging from online video streaming to medical delivery. However, to enable a reliable wireless connectivity for the UAVs as well as a secure operation, various challenges need to be addressed such as interference management, mobility management and handover, cyber-physical attacks, and authentication. In this paper, the goal is to expose the wireless and security challenges that arise in the context of UAV-based delivery systems, UAV-based real-time multimedia streaming, and UAV-enabled intelligent transportation systems. To address such challenges, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) based solution schemes are introduced. The introduced approaches enable the UAVs to adaptively exploit the wireless system resources while guaranteeing a secure operation, in real-time. Preliminary simulation results show the beneﬁts of the introduced solutions for each of the aforementioned cellular-connected UAV application use case.},
